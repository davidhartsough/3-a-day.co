# 3-a-day

[3-a-day.co](https://3-a-day.co/) is a web app I built back in 2016.

The goal was to create a place for people to practice positivity by writing down 3 things that went well and why they went well every day.

It was inspired by a positive psychology exercise to practice positive emotion. I discovered this through the research of Martin E.P. Seligman in his book _Flourish_.
